Introduction to JavaScript
Originally designed for adding small amounts of interactivity to a page (like hovers and animations), JavaScript is now used for almost anything up to large applications and games, and can even be found in servers.

Common uses of JavaScript include:

- Alert messages
- Popup windows
- Dynamic dropdown menus
- Form validation
- Displaying date/time

## Variables

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
